# ML Directional Edge

Build and operate the `ml_directional` strategy as an in-repo module. This strategy is intentionally split into two parts:

- **Offline ML pipeline** in `src/ml/`
- **Live execution strategy** in `src/strategies/ml_directional_strategy.py`

## What Is Implemented

- OHLCV loader and normalization in `src/ml/data_loader.py`
- Time-safe multi-timeframe feature engineering in `src/ml/features.py`
- Richer candle-derived OHLC features including ATR, momentum, volatility, EMA/SMA distances, EMA/SMA slopes, RSI, breakout distance, and volume z-score
- Optional microstructure aggregation from the collector SQLite DB into training-ready `micro_*` columns
- LightGBM-compatible model/artifact wrapper in `src/ml/model.py`
- Walk-forward training and evaluation in `src/ml/train.py` and `src/ml/evaluate.py`
- Dedicated replay harness in `src/ml/backtest.py`
- Binance microstructure collector in `src/ml/collectors/binance_depth.py`
- Live strategy registration and runtime safety rails in `src/strategies/ml_directional_strategy.py`

## Important Reality Check

The master plan is a **two-stage build**, not a single-step train-and-trade flow.

1. **You can train immediately** on OHLCV-only features.
2. **You cannot train the full microstructure-enhanced model immediately** unless you already have enough collected Binance depth / trades / liquidations / funding / OI history.

### Is microstructure data used for training too?

Yes. The intended final model uses microstructure features in training, not just live inference.

The collector now writes raw depth, agg trades, liquidations, funding, and open interest to SQLite, and the offline loader can aggregate that into training-ready `micro_*` features such as:

- `micro_obi_l1`, `micro_obi_l5`, `micro_obi_l10`
- `micro_cvd_1m`, `micro_cvd_5m`, `micro_cvd_15m`
- `micro_liq_delta_1m`, `micro_liq_delta_5m`
- `micro_funding_rate`
- `micro_open_interest`, `micro_open_interest_delta`

### Do you need 2-4 weeks before you can start training?

- **For the baseline model:** no. Train now with OHLCV-only features.
- **For the full signal stack from the master plan:** yes, you should collect roughly 2-4 weeks of microstructure data first.

That matches the master plan exactly: establish the OHLCV baseline first, then add microstructure once enough data has accumulated.

## Current Direction

- The current primary baseline is the upgraded OHLC-only feature stack.
- The current full-history artifact lineup is:
  - `ml_directional_15m_ohlc_full.pkl`
  - `ml_directional_1h_ohlc_full.pkl`
  - `ml_directional_4h_ohlc_full.pkl`
  - `ml_directional_1d_ohlc_full.pkl`
- Current ranking after training the upgraded OHLC artifacts:
  - `15m_full` — strongest current candidate
  - `1h_full` — second-best candidate
  - `4h_full` — viable research artifact, weaker than 15m/1h
  - `1d_full` — weak current candidate, not a live favorite
- The fair overlap comparison currently favors OHLC-only over OHLC + micro on the March-April 2026 window.
- Until a later comparison proves otherwise, improve the OHLC baseline first and only revisit microstructure after that baseline is fully evaluated.

## Candle-Derived Feature Set

The offline trainer and live training-schema parity path both use the same candle-derived family of features. The current stack includes:

- Candle geometry:
  - body
  - range
  - body ratio
  - wick ratio
  - close-to-range position
- Return and volatility structure:
  - return
  - log return
  - ATR
  - ATR percent
  - momentum windows
  - rolling volatility windows
- Trend and mean-reversion structure:
  - SMA distance
  - EMA distance
  - SMA slope
  - EMA slope
  - EMA gap
  - RSI
- Breakout and participation structure:
  - breakout distance to rolling high
  - breakout distance to rolling low
  - volume z-score
- Context features:
  - hour sine/cosine
  - weekday sine/cosine

The binary target remains the same for every target timeframe:

- `target_up = 1` when the **next candle close is above the next candle open**
- `target_up = 0` otherwise

That means:

- `15m` predicts the next `15m` candle direction
- `1h` predicts the next `1h` candle direction
- `4h` predicts the next `4h` candle direction
- `1d` predicts the next `1d` candle direction

## Storage Layout

- `data/ml/ohlc/` — BTC OHLCV CSVs
- `data/ml/artifacts/` — trained model bundles
- `data/ml/collectors/` — collector SQLite outputs

## Config Placement

Put ML directional runtime knobs in your shared profile config such as `config/settings.chr.live`, not in `.env`.

 The CHR profile now includes an explicit `ML_DIRECTIONAL_*` section with conservative defaults:
 
 - `ML_DIRECTIONAL_ENABLED=false`
 - `ML_DIRECTIONAL_MODEL_PATH=./data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_latest.pkl`
 - `ML_DIRECTIONAL_MODEL_PATH_15M=./data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_15m_ohlc_full.pkl`
 - `ML_DIRECTIONAL_MODEL_PATH_1H=./data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_1h_ohlc_full.pkl`
 - `ML_DIRECTIONAL_ENABLED_HORIZONS=15m,1h`
 - `ML_DIRECTIONAL_MIN_PROBABILITY=0.53`
 - `ML_DIRECTIONAL_MIN_EDGE=0.03`
 - `ML_DIRECTIONAL_MAKER_OFFSET=0.005`
 - `ML_DIRECTIONAL_SIGNAL_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=45`
- `ML_BINANCE_COLLECTOR_DB=./data/ml/collectors/binance_microstructure.sqlite`

## CLI Scripts

These scripts now exist and are the recommended operator entrypoints.

### 1. Collect Binance microstructure

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.collect_binance_microstructure --symbol btcusdt
```

What it does:

- subscribes to **Binance futures** WebSocket (depth, agg trades, force-order/liquidations) — liquidations only exist on the futures stream
- polls funding rate and open interest from the futures REST API
- writes to `data/ml/collectors/binance_microstructure.sqlite`

Override with `BINANCE_FUTURES_WS_COMBINED_URL` if needed (default: `wss://fstream.binance.com/stream`). See `docs/strategies/ml-directional-edge/COLLECTOR_VPS_DEPLOY.md` for VPS deploy and upgrade steps.

### 2. Check collector quality

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.check_microstructure_quality --db-path data/ml/collectors/binance_microstructure.sqlite
```

What it does:

- prints row counts for each collector table
- shows the latest timestamp seen in each table

### 3. Train OHLC-only full-history artifacts

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.train_ml_directional --target-timeframe 15m --artifact-path data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_15m_ohlc_full.pkl
./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.train_ml_directional --target-timeframe 1h --artifact-path data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_1h_ohlc_full.pkl
./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.train_ml_directional --target-timeframe 4h --artifact-path data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_4h_ohlc_full.pkl
./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.train_ml_directional --target-timeframe 1d --artifact-path data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_1d_ohlc_full.pkl
```

What it does:

- loads OHLCV from `data/ml/ohlc/`
- builds a leakage-aware training frame
- selects a sensible default timeframe stack for the chosen target horizon
- runs walk-forward training
- exports an artifact to the path you provide

Default frame stacks by target:

- `15m` target: `15m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`
- `1h` target: `1h`, `4h`, `1d`
- `4h` target: `4h`, `1d`
- `1d` target: `1d`

What it does not yet do:

- does not add probability calibration on top of the exported live threshold
- does not enforce a dedicated final untouched holdout after walk-forward selection
- does not yet gate promotion with the full master-plan acceptance checks automatically
- does not yet emit a machine-readable training report for artifact promotion workflows

Treat the current baseline trainer as a research-grade baseline, not the final promotion gate.

### 4. Train with microstructure

Only do this after enough collector history exists.

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.train_ml_directional \
  --target-timeframe 15m \
  --include-microstructure \
  --microstructure-db data/ml/collectors/binance_microstructure.sqlite
```

### 5. Replay backtest

Do this after a baseline artifact exists. It is safe to defer replay until training is producing artifacts you actually want to compare.

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.backtest_ml_directional \
  --model-path data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_latest.pkl \
  --market-type 15m \
  --coin btc
```

### 6. Run live in paper mode

 First set these in your profile config:
 
 ```dotenv
 PAPER_TRADING=true
 ML_DIRECTIONAL_ENABLED=true
 ML_DIRECTIONAL_MODEL_PATH_15M=./data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_15m_ohlc_full.pkl
 ML_DIRECTIONAL_MODEL_PATH_1H=./data/ml/artifacts/ml_directional_1h_ohlc_full.pkl
 ```
 
 Then run:
 
 ```bash
 BOT_PUBLIC_CONFIG_FILE=./config/settings.chr.ml_paper.env BOT_WALLET_ID=CHR ./.venv/bin/python -m src.bot --strategy ml_directional
 ```

## Live Strategy Notes

- The live strategy only trades crypto `Up or Down` markets on horizons enabled by `ML_DIRECTIONAL_ENABLED_HORIZONS`.
- It assumes maker-first execution and requires model edge to clear a friction buffer.
- Final trade admission and resizing still flow through the bot and `RiskManager`.
- Runtime feature rows are aligned to the artifact’s `feature_columns`.
- OHLC-trained artifacts are supported live through reconstructed training-schema rows from recent Binance OHLC history.
- Micro-trained artifacts are intentionally blocked live until true `micro_*` runtime parity exists.
- Safety rails include feed staleness halts, rolling accuracy / Brier monitoring, and automatic pauses after loss streaks.
- The strategy now suppresses both-side exposure on the same `condition_id` while an order or unresolved position is active.
- Live order / fill reconciliation now prefers the authenticated Polymarket user WebSocket and falls back to REST/exchange sync.
- The TUI now shows live open-position mark, unrealized PnL, and PnL % for filled ML positions.
- Resolution tracking is still conservative: it works only when the market is still observable after expiry, so do not treat rolling paper metrics as final audit-grade stats yet.

## Lean Mode Notes

Lean mode is intended for low-latency single-strategy runs:

- It narrows the market universe to the configured BTC short-term buckets
- It narrows the Binance feed to the configured lean symbols at construction time
- It is appropriate for `ml_directional` live runs and also for single-strategy `terminal_convergence` runs when you want faster startup and less market-fetch overhead

Operationally, lean mode is only as good as the current Gamma event naming. If Polymarket changes short-term market slugs or titles, re-check bucket matching before live deployment.

## Collector Status And Sanity Checks

Your latest collector run looks healthy:

- `depth_snapshots`, `agg_trades`, and `funding_open_interest` are all increasing over time
- websocket connectivity is confirmed
- `liquidations=0` is acceptable during quiet windows and does not by itself indicate collector failure

Keep checking freshness with:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m scripts.check_microstructure_quality --db-path data/ml/collectors/binance_microstructure.sqlite
```

Healthy expectations:

- `depth_snapshots` should keep climbing quickly
- `agg_trades` should keep climbing during active market hours
- `funding_open_interest` should step up on each REST poll
- latest timestamps should remain close to wall-clock time

## VPS Collector Deploy

Chosen deployment target:

- location: `Germany`
- OS: `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS`

Why:

- Ubuntu LTS is the lowest-friction target for Python + systemd operations
- final region validation should be based on `VPS -> Binance` latency and stability, not `Brazil -> VPS` latency

Deployment guide: `docs/strategies/ml-directional-edge/VPS_DEPLOY.md`

Bootstrap script: `scripts/setup_ml_collector_vps.sh`
